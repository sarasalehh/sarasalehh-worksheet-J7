1. What is inside a packet?
A packet contains a header which stores where the data is going, and a payload which stores the data or the message. 

2. What is the purpose of an internet layer in the TCP/IP protocol? What do you, as a client, need to specify in this protocol?
At each layer of the stack, a different protocol comes to bare for forwarding the packet to the next hop. The purpose of the internet layer is to inter-connect networks. As a client, you need to specify the IP address of a machine at this layer so that you can interact with it. 

3. What is the purpose of the transport layer in the TCP/IP protocol? What do you, as a client, need to specify in this protocol?
When 2 processes running on different computers are actually sending and receiving data across the vastness of the Internet, the transport layer provides an abstraction for those two process to apear as if they are communicating directly with each other. The transport layer also provides ports which differentiate communication destined for one process versus another as processes can be communicating in the network at the same time.

4. What is the difference between SMTP and HTTP?
SMTP is used to transmit email messages and HTTP is used to download web content.

5. What is the difference between an IP address and a domain name?
Domain names are used to identify a networked device - they are human readable addresses; IP addresses are what computers are actually identified by when they visit the web as they show the precise location of the server.

6. How does the operating system use ports?
The port address is a way for the Operating System to divide up the data arriving from the network based on the destination process. The ports allows the operating system differentiate traffic for each application when there are multiple running at the same time.

7. Write code that creates a socket connection to ip address 123.45.678.900 at port 4040. Then, print a color to that socket’s output.
try{
  Socket s = new Socket("123.45.678.900", 4040);
  PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());
            pw.println("red");
            pw.close(); //close the stream
            sock.close();//close the socket
}
catch (exception e) {
  System.err.println("Cannot Connect");
  System.exit(1);
}

8. What is the difference between a socket’s input stream and its output stream?
We can both read from the server via the socket’s InputStream and write to the server via the OutputStream.

9. What is the difference between a Socket and a SocketServer?
The server socket can accept more connections from other client sockets. It can then communicate with them with an input and output stream specific to that socket. A server can accept connections from multiple sockets at the same time.

10. How are threads useful with servers? How does a server manage to always be listening for sockets trying to connect?
A threaded socket server starts a new thread for each thread so that the main thread can continue to listen to incoming connections. We can use an infinite loop to be listening for new connections from client socket. Each connection is passed on to its own thread for processing, freeing up the server to continue to listen for more connections while processing client requests via the threads.
